Shows player icon (Without save it's a grey icon), name and level. 
Needs a player object to get name, and current level, will create another 
constructor when i have created this object.

## Day 4

Working in the words showing, still need to create the class that reads and writes files.
- [x] Add Read and Write class.
- [ ] Fix comet speed.

### Created two new components

[Rotate Label](https://github.com/Ingrid-E/Memory_Word_Game/blob/main/MemordyComponents/src/components/RotateLabel.java)
------------

Creates a rotated JLabel, it works to put the titled word inside the comet.

[Comet Moving](https://github.com/Ingrid-E/Memory_Word_Game/blob/main/MemordyComponents/src/components/CometMoving.java)
------------

Creates a JPanel that contains the Comet and the word, has a setText method to change the text shown in the comet.

------------------------

Made a new class [Game Controls](https://github.com/Ingrid-E/Memory_Word_Game/blob/main/Memordy/src/memordy/GameControls.java) to control the comets and everything realted to gameplay, doesn't have much yet.

Thinking of making a font component to not load Nasalization in each class i need it.

## Day 5

Added Player Class which contains basic player info.

Added GameData Class which reads and writes game data in a .txt file. Using ObjectOutputStream, the data class contains the players in an ArrayList.

Added another constructor to ChooseSavedGame that makes the component with player icon and data.

Added another constructor to ImageResize that adds Icon compability, it first turns the Icon to Image than load to ImageFile.

- [ ] Add scroll when there are more than 3 players.
- [ ] Add choose player in load game.
- [ ] Finish game concept

## Day 6

Organized gaming components in GameControls and left all releated to interface in MainMenu.java.

Added words to game, and randomized words for each player, so they will have a random order of words but they wont repeat.

Saved the information in a HashMap for player and player words.

Example:

```json
{"Ingrid": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4", "word5",...],
 "Jhonatan": ["word3", "word1", "word2", "word7", "word4",...]
}
```

That way words do not repeat for every player in the same order.

- [ ] Add Write words GUI
- [ ] Add Next Level functions
- [ ] Add go back to menu function
- [ ] Add Load existing game

Added ArrayList to GameData so the comets show the order of the words.
