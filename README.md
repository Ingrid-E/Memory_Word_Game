[Comet Moving](https://github.com/Ingrid-E/Memory_Word_Game/blob/main/MemordyComponents/src/components/CometMoving.java)

------------------------

Made a new class [Game Controls](https://github.com/Ingrid-E/Memory_Word_Game/blob/main/Memordy/src/memordy/GameControls.java) to control the comets and everything realted to gameplay, doesn't have much yet.

Thinking of making a font component to not load Nasalization in each class i need it.

## Day 5

Added Player Class which contains basic player info.

Added GameData Class which reads and writes game data in a .txt file. Using ObjectOutputStream, the data class contains the players in an ArrayList.

Added another constructor to ChooseSavedGame that makes the component with player icon and data.

Added another constructor to ImageResize that adds Icon compability, it first turns the Icon to Image than load to ImageFile.

- [ ] Add scroll when there are more than 3 players.
- [ ] Add choose player in load game.
- [ ] Finish game concept

## Day 6

Organized gaming components in GameControls and left all releated to interface in MainMenu.java.

Added words to game, and randomized words for each player, so they will have a random order of words but they wont repeat.

Saved the information in a HashMap for player and player words.

Example:

```json
{"Ingrid": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4", "word5",...],
 "Jhonatan": ["word3", "word1", "word2", "word7", "word4",...]
}
```

That way words do not repeat for every player in the same order.

- [x] Add Write words GUI
- [ ] Add Next Level functions
- [ ] Add go back to menu function
- [ ] Add Load existing game

Added ArrayList to GameData so the comets show the order of the words.

## Day 7

- [x] ** When creating new player, add restrintions to same name and obligatry to choose icon or else it will generate errors **

Fix Adding enter and adding the words in a gridLayout mode

## Day 8
got stuck all day trying to do something that is not posible. F

## Day 9

Made JTable that shows words with invisible background and added a font size that works for all words that are it's len is 13 or lower.

What if the user inputs a word longer? Will it break the code?
Yes... need to **fix that**

## Day 10

No! Dont need to fix that because the only words that will get added to the word table are that ones that are correct!

Added enconding to file reader so that it comes out with "tildes" and i can do a spanish version. 

Creating word level game array containenr so that it contains the words of the two sets for the player.
